This package contains the actual programs that we might run. I suggest that these do roughly the following

Create a world model.
(Possibly handle vision calibration)  
Start the vision system, passing the model for it to be updated.
Set up bluetooth connections.
Start a strategy, passing the world and the bluetooth connections to it.
(Possibly wait for the strategy to finish and then start it again)
