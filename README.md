The code that will be run on a DICE machine, separate from the NXT code that will run on the bricks

V4l4j and BoofCV
==================

I have included the jar files (and the compiled executables for v4l4j) inside the repository and, in theory, it _should_ be possible to just checkout the repository and the vision would work straight away on DICE i.e. the idea **is that we shouldn't include the jar files locally on each of ours' laptops/DICE accounts but rather they should be inside the repository itself**  . At the moment of writing, this is working on my own machine i.e. I can run all the classes in src.vision .
